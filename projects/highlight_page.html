	    <p> Goats produce milk that is creamier and many find easier to digest then the milk from cows. Certainly better for you then the dairy products we buy at the grocery store. Many people also enjoy other goat dairy products like goat cheese. Goat cheese typicaly has a sharper tast then cheese made from cows milk that some poeple love and others do not. Goat yogurt and Kefer also have a following and are not as sharp flavored as the cheese. If you get the chance try it out! Quality fresh goats milk is a real treat both to the palate and to your body.</p>
