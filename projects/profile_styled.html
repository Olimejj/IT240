	<h3>Answers</h3>
	<p>A relative path is a path from where you currently are in the directory to the file needed. One example would be:<span> "&lt;a href="./folder/file.html"&gt;fake example&lt;/a&gt;"</span></p>
        <p>An absolute path in a hyper link is not a path based on where you are but it uses the domain name and file path to the file needed. This allows you to link to pages and resources on other websites. Here is an example:<span> "&lt;a href="http://domain.com/folder/file.html"&gt;fake example Absolute link&lt;/a&gt;"</span></p>

<article> <h3>Page review</h3>
	<p>Kiribati Institute of Technology recently re-did their website you can find it here: <a href="https://kit.edu.ki">kit.edu.ki</a>.  Kiribati Institute of Technology or KIT is one of two higher learing schools in Kiribati. They focus on industry trades and certifications. They are sponcered by Australia and follow the Austrailian standards in ther certifications.</p>
	<p> I am actually very impressed in their new site. The moment you get on you get to see two smiling faces of students making it a very friendly welcome. It is also very functional. The navigation accross the top makes it easy to find anything you need and as you scroll down you can see some great news type articles to greet you. I also really like the color scheme that they chose and how well it fits with the pictures. Its very gentle but modern.</p>
	<p>They cater very specifically to an audiance of guests or perspective students. They make it easy to find programs and faculty and give good descriptions for both. It does not seem like a site that faculty or current students would really use. It is important to identify your audiance when building a site and they obviosly have with theirs.</p>

<h3>Color Selection</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I chose these colors because I wanted somthing that would be gentle and positive. I feel like this mix is easy to look at and friendly. </li>
  <li>These colors have a calming effect on people but still look professional</li>
  <li>I added the light blue to the headers to really help them to stand out. I used the size of font to Deflect attention in a few places</li>
  <li> I used the tool: <a href="https://coolors.co/cc8b86-f9eae1-7d4f50-d1be9c-aa998f">coolors.co</a> to autogenerate color combinations until I found one I liked. I still added the light blue to the headers however to help the to stand out from the rest of the text.</li>
