	<h3>Site Analysis</h3>
	<a href="https://macmall.com">macmall.com</a>
	<h4>The Items that got my attention:</h4>
	<p>When I went to the site the first thing I noticed was the asthetic table of images of mac laptops.</p>
	<p>I also noticed the name/logo and how it looks professional.</p>
	<h4>Where I looked for navigation:</h4>
	<p>For the most part I looked for and found the navication at the top. I almost used non of it though as I was already in the right spot from my google search.</p>
	<h4>What items I read and what I did not:</h4>
	<p>There is a sliding banner at the top of the front page of the site and I did not even look at it because I already knew what I was there for and that was macbook pros</p>
	<p>I noticed emidiantly the names of the laptops under their pictures and read until I saw "MacBook Pro" and "MacBook Pro with Retina Display" picked one and clicked on it.</p>
	<p>once on the page for macbook pros I noticed all the categories "Latest Models" and "Previos Models" also note it was organized like the apple stores 15" model vs 13" model</p>
	<h4>What made the site easy to use:</h4>
	<p>First would be its feeling like apple.com which I am familiar with. It also really made great use of images and the accociated text was allways very well organized.</p>
	<p>There were not tons and tons of options to look at but instead it followed the same model as apple store does where you pick a base model and configure it</p>
	<h4>What made the site difficult to use:</h4>
	<p>I was disapointed that there was no way to filter out the 15" from the 13" pros. It should not have been that hard for them to have an option that filters those out</p>
	<p>on the front page it has an icon/link for "MacBook Pro" and "MacBook Pro with Retina Display" but both of them take you to the same page because Apple has not sold not retina display macbook pros in a long time and macmall does not carry older models past 2017.</p>
	<h4>Did I allways know where I was on the site</h4>
	<p>Yes, simply because I was only ever 2 clicks from the home page. There was a short moment where I had to figure out how to get back to the home page but clicking on the name/logo took me there like it does on most sites.</p>
	<h3>Further analisys of the site:</h3>
	<h4>What is the target audiance:</h4>
	<p>Clearly their target audiance is mac users. The feel of the site is patterened after the Apple Store and everything focuses on the macs first then shows what you can git to suppor them.</p>
	<p>Anothing thing is for people looking to save a bit on their computer. The prices I found on MacMall were comparable to the student discount on the apple store. So if you did not have student discount or if the season had no deals then this site would be cheaper.</p>
	<p>They did have some models from last year but everything was still unused and one year back is still pretty recent so I would say they are not getting bargan audiance. Not after people looking for a cheap laptop</p>
	<h4>How was the site organized:</h4>
	<p>The site organization was very simple. First you get to your home page wich lists in picture format all of the models of computers they sell then when you click on one it takes you to a list of all the computers of that model with the option of cliking a button to switch to "older models". Once you click on the laptop your interested in it shows you all the specs and gives you an upgradable list to personalize your computer and a price that updates with it.</p>
	<p>The main navigation was a dropdown menu on the top left of the page that I never tourched because I was already in the section for mac computers and was not looking for anything else.</p>
	<h4>How did the site use Repition, Contrast, Proximity and Alignment to highlight certain elements:</h4>
	<p>The first thing I would say is that it followed closely the patterns setup by Apple so even in that there was repitition. It did this by having all the laptop info pages formated the same way and by listing out all the computers in the same way for the different models.</p>
	<p>The site uses images that stand out clearly from the white background and each image has a very simple description under it for the computer model. The way they did it there is not a crowding of images and there is not a lot of text on the front page. It makes those items stand out to make it easy to pick what you are looking for.</p>
	<p>all of the navigation links were together at the top making it easy to find them due to proximity.</p>
	<p>All of the images for the laptop models are aligned in such a way to make it easy to view them all.</p>
	<h4>What things did the site have that made it accesible for people with disabilities:</h4>
	<p>It did not use colors in a way that would make it hard for somebody who is color blind to navigate the page. All images have accosiated text and alt text</p>
	<h4>How was the text used on the site:</h4>
	<p>On the front page the text was used very lightly only as a description for the images. One the information pages it had options to read more by cliking on certain links but the text while informative was not over the top and really just focused on displaying the specs and prices.</p>
	<h4>What was the color scheme, and what did it say to you:</h4>
	<p>The colors were mainly blue,dark blue and white with red text to make deals popout</p>
	<h4>What graphics were used, What about multimedia:</h4>
	<p>There was a sliding banner at the top with simple images and there were lots of images of computers used. They also showed pictures and icons during the laptop personalizing phase</p>
	<h4>How did this site look in a mobile browser:</h4>
	<p>Everything looked great on the mobile. You can tell that it was build with mobile in mind as a dynamic site</p>

	<h3>Favorite & Least Favorite</h3>
	<a href="https://macmall.com">macmall.com</a>
	<p>Of the two new sites I prefered macmall because it felt a lot like shopping on the apple store. I could find things I was looking for and the pictures and links felt a lot like Apple store.</p>
	<p>The other reason I liked it was because it was easy for me to find what I was looking for and the prices and specs displayed up front were correct</p>	
	<a href="https://eshop.macsales.com">eshop.macsales.com refurbished</a>
	<p>I did not like eshop because the prices displayed were not actually the correct prices. They would display the configuration as what it could be maxed out to and the prices as what it was minimum which I found not helpful.</p>
	<p>I also felt like they were focused more on the extras then the laptops. Perhaps if I was shopping for extras and not a computer they would be a great place to go.</p>
	<p>It also felt messy and not as pleasing to use or to view.</p>
