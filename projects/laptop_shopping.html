	<h3>Site Analysis</h3>
	<a href="https://macmall.com">macmall.com</a>
	<h4>The Items that got my attention:</h4>
	<p>When I went to the site the first thing I noticed was the asthetic table of images of mac laptops.</p>
	<p>I also noticed the name/logo and how it looks professional.</p>
	<h4>Where I looked for navigation:</h4>
	<h4>What items I read and what I did not:</h4>
	<p>There is a sliding banner at the top of the front page of the site and I did not even look at it because I already knew what I was there for and that was macbook pros</p>
	<p>I noticed emidiantly the names of the laptops under their pictures and read until I saw "MacBook Pro" and "MacBook Pro with Retina Display" picked one and clicked on it.</p>
	<p>once on the page for macbook pros I noticed all the categories "Latest Models" and "Previos Models" also note it was organized like the apple stores 15" model vs 13" model</p>
	
	<h4>What made the site easy to use:</h4>
	<p>First would be its feeling like apple.com which I am familiar with. It also really made great use of images and the accociated text was allways very well organized.</p>
	<p>There were not tons and tons of options to look at but instead it followed the same model as apple store does where you pick a base model and configure it</p>
	<h4>What made the site difficult to use:</h4>
	<p>I was disapointed that there was no way to filter out the 15" from the 13" pros. It should not have been that hard for them to have an option that filters those out</p>
	<p>on the front page it has an icon/link for "MacBook Pro" and "MacBook Pro with Retina Display" but both of them take you to the same page because Apple has not sold not retina display macbook pros in a long time and macmall does not carry older models past 2017.</p>
	<h4>Did I allways know where I was on the site</h4>
	<p>Yes, simply because I was only ever 2 clicks from the home page. There was a short moment where I had to figure out how to get back to the home page but clicking on the name/logo took me there like it does on most sites.</p>

	<h3>Favorite & Least Favorite</h3>
	<a href="https://macmall.com">macmall.com</a>
	<p>Of the two new sites I prefered macmall because it felt a lot like shopping on the apple store. I could find things I was looking for and the pictures and links felt a lot like Apple store.</p>
	<p>The other reason I liked it was because it was easy for me to find what I was looking for and the prices and specs displayed up front were correct</p>	
	<a href="https://eshop.macsales.com">eshop.macsales.com refurbished</a>
	<p>I did not like eshop because the prices displayed were not actually the correct prices. They would display the configuration as what it could be maxed out to and the prices as what it was minimum which I found not helpful.</p>
	<p>I also felt like they were focused more on the extras then the laptops. Perhaps if I was shopping for extras and not a computer they would be a great place to go.</p>
	<p>It also felt messy and not as pleasing to use or to view.</p>
