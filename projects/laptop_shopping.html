	<h3>Favorite & Least Favorite</h3>
	<a href="https://macmall.com">macmall.com</a>
	<p>Of the two new sites I prefered macmall because it felt a lot like shopping on the apple store. I could find things I was looking for and the pictures and links felt a lot like Apple store.</p>
	<p>The other reason I liked it was because it was easy for me to find what I was looking for and the prices and specs displayed up front were correct</p>	
	<a href="https://eshop.macsales.com">eshop.macsales.com refurbished</a>
	<p>I did not like eshop because the prices displayed were not actually the correct prices. They would display the configuration as what it could be maxed out to and the prices as what it was minimum which I found not helpful.</p>
	<p>I also felt like they were focused more on the extras then the laptops. Perhaps if I was shopping for extras and not a computer they would be a great place to go.</p>
	<p>It also felt messy and not as pleasing to use or to view.</p>
