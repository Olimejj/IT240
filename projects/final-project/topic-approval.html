<h3>Site Purpose</h3>
<p> The purpose of the site is to showcase an entreprenurial project that I am working on. This site will act as a landing page for that project.</p>
<h3> The Website Should: </h3>
<p>provide a place for people to go and see my project/product and submit their emails so they can be on the development list. The real goal is to collect a list of emails of interested people so that when I move on to crowdfunding and launch the product I have early users to reach out to </p>
<h3>My Audiance Will Be</h3>
<p>The people who come to my site will be those that were interested in adds that I run online and social media campagings. I am anticipating that they will be predominantly Moms because of the nature of my product</p> 
<h3>What Opportunity Is Being Addressed:</h3>
<p> We have a project comming together but no landing page or website with which to showcase it. This site will be providing us a place to send people and collect that traffic.</p>
<h3> What will the site content be:</h3>
<p> Mostly The content will be images and stories about our product. It will include a video and some forms that can be filled out </p>
<h3>Two similar sites:</h3>
<a href="https://www.pomelotravel.com/">Pomelo Travel</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.segway.com">Segway</a>
<h3>My Reason:</h3>
<p>I have been working on this project for a while now and next semester we want to prepare for the cowdfunding launch. This is going to require a webpresance. The other reason is because all this needs to be is a simple landing page so it fits into this simple projects scope pretty well.</p>
