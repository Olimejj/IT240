						<p>I started school with the goal of graduating debt free. I studied at BYUH and by living as a poor college student, working part time and working as much as possible during the Summer breaks I was able to maintain that until my grades droped and I lost most of my scholorship then got married and started having kids! At this point student debt became almost unavoidable if I wanted to finish school so I started taking out loans and before I knew it I had gotten carried away and was still 2 semesters short of graduation with $25,000 in student loans. </p><p> It took a lot of work but I was able to turn that around so that my final 2 semesters saw that debt cut down a bit instead of continuing to grow. Once graduated I continued my methods of paying down debt and soon found myself debt free. On my Journey I picked up some things that I hope to share with others in similar possition. I learned that it is not only about getting out of debt as quickly as possible but excelling and enjoying the get out of debt journey.</p>
