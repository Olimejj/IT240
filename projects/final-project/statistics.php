		The article goes on to say <q>Youâ€™re probably going to die with some debt to your name. Most people do</q> many people belive today that having debt is normal and as long as you manage it there is no problem right? NO! this ideology is what keeps you poor. If you go through your life balancing your debt at a "maintainable" amount then what do you plan on doing for retirment? The truth is interest will count for or against you and if your carrying $15,000 in debt all the time and your paying an interest rate of 6% then you are loosing out on $900 a year. Now imagine if you invested that $900 a year at an anual interest rate of 6% within 10 years you could have a savings worth over $11,000!</p>
